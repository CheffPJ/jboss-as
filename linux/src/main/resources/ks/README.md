JBoss AS7 on Linux Kickstarts
============================

We'll put some sample kickstarts here for building basic images. Cll them appliances if you are so inclined.

First on the list
-----------------
* Fedora 15 Generic Node
  * Ideally, we'll even point to some publicly available repositores so users don't even have to download content if they just run the virsh-install scripts provided in <TODO>
  * Useful mirrors
